  [![NPM Downloads][downloads-image]][downloads-url]

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express() 
const idempotency = require('express-idempotent-redis');
let redis = require("redis"),
    client = redis.createClient();

let counter = 0;
app.use(idempotency({
    redisClient: client
}));

app.get('/', (req, res) =>  {
    counter++;
    res.send(`Hello. This route was executed ${counter} times`);
})

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!'))
```

## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Node.js 0.10 or higher is required.

Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```bash
$ npm install express
$ npm install redis
$ npm install express-idempotent-redis 
```

## Features

  * Works as Cache for Express using Redis
  * Focus on high performance
  * Guarantees Idempotent calls for all HTTP verbs

## Guide

  The API caller needs to send a IdEmpotent key on header (Default is 'IDEmpKey')
  The builder accepts the following parameters:
    redisClient => Mandatory. This will be your already initiated Redis Client
    idempotencyKey => The key that will be monitored (Default is 'IDEmpKey')
    sleepTime => As your route will only be executed once, this is how long subsequent calls should wait for the main (first) request to finish
    


## Philosophy

  The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making
  it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public
  HTTP APIs.

  Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over
  14 template engines via [Consolidate.js](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js),
  you can quickly craft your perfect framework.
